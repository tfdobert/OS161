# os161-Kernel-Src-Add-System-Call-Assignment
Base kernel suitable for Assignment on adding system calls

This repository is the `src` folder of OS/161. This `src/` is especially designed for this assignment. 
Clone this repository from inside `~/os161` so it exists at the same level of the already existing `src/` directory. 

Once you clone the repository, you will see that it will have a long name, something like `fall2020-assignment-01-os-161-code-reading-<your-github_username>`. For example, github user `brucewayne` would have this repository named `fall2020-assignment-01-os-161-code-reading-brucewayne`. Despite its name, this directory is actually your `src/` for your new OS/161 kernel (the new `src/` you will use for the assignment). 

You don't need to rename the cloned directory to `src`. But, it is fine if you want to change the directory's name to `src/` for some reason (e.g., name is too long!). Here, you will need to rename the previous `src/` directory or simply delete it.  

Follow the instructions to complete the assignment.
